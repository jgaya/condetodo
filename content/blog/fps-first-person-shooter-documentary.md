March 11, 2021: CREATORVC, the acclaimed production company behind IN SEARCH OF THE LAST ACTION HEROES and IN SEARCH OF DARKNESS, is currently developing FPS: FIRST PERSON SHOOTER, the definitive documentary on one of gaming’s most popular genres.
FPS will be an in-depth, fan-driven retrospective exploring the history of the genre, from its
origins in the 1970s and 80s through to the golden age of the 1990s, with the likes of Quake,
Duke Nukem 3D, and Doom, moving all the way into the modern-day domination of titles such
as Overwatch, Call of Duty, and Halo, plus everything in between.
CREATORVC is rolling out our awareness campaign on March 11, and we are looking for FPS
superfans to sign up and be part of our free community — where they can not only follow
along with our progress but also actively help shape the documentary’s development. We
want gamers’ input on which games to cover, what weapons and levels and characters to
discuss, who among the genre’s luminaries and influencers we should interview, which
moments were the best in the genre’s history, and much more.

The documentary will focus on the best, most-groundbreaking and popular entries in the FPS genre. As CREATORVC progresses through development, our goal is to have the audience co-create the project and offer expertise on the games and subjects they wish to spotlight.
Ultimately, we want the documentary to highlight the most significant FPS games of the last
45 years and the key figures that made them possible.
