## Letra

> Winter's cityside, crystal bits of snowflakes\
> All around my head and in the wind\
> I had no illusions that I'd ever find\
> A glimpse of summer's heatwaves in your eyes\
> You did what you did to me\
> Now it's history, I see\
> Here's my comeback on the road again\
> Things will happen while they can\
> I will wait here for my man tonight\
> It's easy when you're big in Japan\
> Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight\
> Big in Japan, be tight\
> Big in Japan, where the Eastern sea's so blue\
> Big in Japan, alright\
> Pay, then I'll sleep by your side\
> Things are easy when you're big in Japan\
> Oh, when you're big in Japan\
> Neon on my naked skin, passing silhouettes\
> Of strange illuminated mannequins\
> Shall I stay here at the zoo\
> Or shall I go and change my point of view\
> For other ugly scenes\
> You did what you did to me\
> Now it's history, I see\
> Things will happen while they can\
> I will wait here for my man tonight\
> It's easy when you're big in Japan\
> Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight\
