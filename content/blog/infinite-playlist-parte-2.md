Segunda entrega de la lista infinita, y arrancamos con rickroll, pero mas alla del meme es una gran cancion que no pasa de moda. Los ochenta siguen siendo mayoria en la lista por ahora pero empiezan a colarse cosas de los 90s y 70s. 

Esta semana mas rockera que la anterior pero no hacemos diferencia si la cancion es buena entra a la lista para disfrutarla.

Como siempre sugerencias y comentarios son bienvenidos, al final de la lista la lista de spotify si quieren seguirla por ahi.

> I can't believe the things that happen to me I guess that I should have seen a long, long time ago Letters you write don't help me get through the night

> All the love, all the love in the world All the love, I'll be sending you girl All the love
> All the love in the world
>
> Time after time I put my life on the line But I ain't committed no crime, so take what you can find Forget what I say 'cause I'll keep running away
> I only live for today, but I'm one day behind
>
> All the love, all the love in the world All the love, I'll be sending you girl All the love
> All the love in the world
>
> These are the words that I whisper on every first night But that day you left me Those words were on that same flight
>
