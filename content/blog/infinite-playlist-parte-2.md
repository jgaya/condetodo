> We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I
>
> A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
> You wouldn't get this from any other guy
>
> I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand
>
> Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down
> Never gonna run around and desert you
> Never gonna make you cry
> Never gonna say goodbye
> Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
>
> We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
> Inside we both know what's been going on
> We know the game and we're gonna play it
> And if you ask me how I'm feeling
> Don't tell me you're too blind to see
>
> Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down
> Never gonna run around and desert you
> Never gonna make you cry
> Never gonna say goodbye
> Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
>
> Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down
> Never gonna run around and desert you
> Never gonna make you cry
> Never gonna say goodbye
> Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
>
> Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)
>
> We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
> Inside we both know what's been going on
> We know the game and we're gonna play it
>
> I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand
>
> Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down
> Never gonna run around and desert you
> Never gonna make you cry
> Never gonna say goodbye
> Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
>
> Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down
> Never gonna run around and desert you
> Never gonna make you cry
> Never gonna say goodbye
> Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
>
> Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down
