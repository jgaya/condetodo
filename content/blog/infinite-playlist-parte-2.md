Segunda entrega de la lista infinita, y arrancamos con rickroll, pero mas alla del meme es una gran cancion que no pasa de moda. Los ochenta siguen siendo mayoria en la lista por ahora pero empiezan a colarse cosas de los 90s y 70s.
Esta semana mas rockera que la anterior pero no hacemos diferencia si la cancion es buena entra a la lista para disfrutarla.

Como siempre sugerencias y comentarios son bienvenidos, al final de la lista la lista de spotify si quieren seguirla por ahi.
